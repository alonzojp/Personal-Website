                <summary>Arknights</summary>
                <p> One of my favorite games is Arknights! Arknights is a tower defense game where players utilize operators to clear a stage.
                    Although the gameplay may look very basic, as you progress the stages become very difficult and fun to clear.
                    Additionally, the game also has an amazing story and constantly produces songs for their game.</p>

                <p>I also enjoy watching different genres of anime!
                    Most of the animes that I enjoy are in the genre of "Slice of Life".

                <p>Creating videos and uploading them onto Youtube is another one of my past-times.
                    I first created my channel on my 13th birthday, and I have been uploading videos on and off up until now.
                    Currently, I make Arknights videos whenever I feel like it.
