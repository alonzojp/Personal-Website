                    Hello! This is the personal website that I'll be working on for the semester.
                    Currently there's not that much on here and it doesn't look that great, but hopefully it'll look nicer as the class goes on
                    and I learn more about web design.
                </p>

                    My name is Jacob Alonzo and I am currently a second year at Cal Poly Pomona studying computer science. I really enjoy the logic
                    aspect of computer science, which was the main reason I decided to choose this major in the first place. I enjoy playing games,
                    making videos, and watching anime, and more information about these three things can be found on the "Hobbies" tab.
